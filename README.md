Project Name: Password Manager

    The Password Manager application will allow the user to enter
and store information on each account they have and save it to a
file on their computer. This file will be encrypted so it can only
be read by reopening it in the application.

NOTE: This application is only using a basic XOR cipher encryption
method and will only really help hide the information from anyone
trying to open the file on your computer. This project was created
simply for the challenge and not meant to be actually used
commercially.
